# Predicting Political Party Affiliation Using Classification Models

## Project Overview
This project predicts political party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on voting records. The dataset consists of voting records on various legislative issues, with votes categorized as 'yes' or 'no', and the target variable indicating party affiliation. The analysis was performed using the Orange data mining tool.
